        <h2>Once a month, one day from 9 till 17.00, I did voluntary work at 't kleine verschil. This is a leisurement organisation for children with a disability. This way the children had a fun day out and the parants had a free day. "t kleine verschil is part of a bigger organisation called Ammarant" </h2>
